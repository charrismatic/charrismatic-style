/// Material Design Timing
/// - mapping of material design standard durations
/// - Material in motion is responsive and natural.
/// - Rather than using a single duration for all animations,
/// - adjust each duration to accommodate the distance travelled, an element's velocity, and surface changes.
/// *Mobile*
/// Transitions on mobile typically occur over 300ms, within this margin of variance:
/// Large, complex, full-screen transitions may have longer durations, occurring over 375ms
/// - Elements entering the screen occur over 225ms
/// - Elements leaving the screen occur over 195ms
/// - Transitions that exceed 400ms may feel too slow.
/// - Objects leaving the screen may have shorter durations, as they require less attention.
/// Desktop
/// Desktop animations should be faster and simpler than their mobile counterparts.
/// These animations should last 150ms to 200ms.
/// Because desktop transitions may be less noticeable,
/// they should be immediately responsive and faster than their mobile counterparts.
