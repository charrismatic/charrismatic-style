///  - Easing curves
///  - Standard curve
///  - Deceleration curve
///  - Acceleration curve
///  - Sharp curve
///  Relative movement
///  Entering or exiting elements that move other on-screen elements do so
///  along a smooth easing curve, so that they remain minimally disruptive
///  and avoid eye-catching, dramatic movement.
///  The standard curve is used for moving elements both in and out of the
///  bounds of the screen. This curve has a slightly longer duration compared
///  to independent elements.
///  ---
///  Entering the screen
///  Elements entering the screen use the deceleration curve for a speedy entrance,
///  indicating that they had been travelling at peak velocity.
///  ---
///  Permanently leaving the screen
///  Elements permanently leaving the screen use the acceleration curve
///  to speed off-screen over a slightly shorter duration,
///  as they will not be returning and require less user focus.
///  ---
///  Temporarily leaving the screen
///  Elements temporarily leaving the screen should use the sharp curve,
///  as they may return to the screen at any time and should appear nearby
///  and within reach.
