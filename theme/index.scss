/// The purpose of this package is for theme configuration  
/// - override or extend current variable values  
/// - set new theme specific variables  
/// - declare theme settings or meta data that would not be appropriate elsewhere  
///  
///  This is not the best place to define many new features and components as they will 
///  not likely make it back to the main library 
/// @example  
///    theme:  
///      primary-color: "blue"
///      secondary-color: "light-blue"
///      theme-name: "demo-them"  
///      fonts: 
///        heading: "Strong Font Bold"
///        body: "Nice Font Light" 
///      icons: [fa-plus, fa-socialmedia, fa-logo]
